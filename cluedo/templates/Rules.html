          <center><p style="max-width:50vw;text-align: center;  " class="fs-3">Wondering how to play Cluedo? This game requires you to master the art of deduction – was it Colonel Mustard in the library with a candlestick or Mrs Peacock in the dining room with the dagger? The truth always comes out eventually...
          Thinking of bringing this classic board game out soon? It'll keep the family entertained for hours – not to mention that it brings out the competitive side of people, too. And it's much shorter than a game of Monopoly, which never hurts.
          Own the classic version of Cluedo but can't find the instructions? Don't you worry: we're here to walk you through the game step by step. All you have to do is correctly guess the murderer, along with the room it happened in and the weapon that was used in order to win.</p><center>

              <h1 class="display-4 fw-normal">What are the rules for Cluedo?</h1>
               <center><p style="max-width:50vw;text-align: center;  " class="fs-3">The idea of Cluedo is to move from room to room to eliminate people, places, and weapons. The player who correctly accuses Who, What, and Where wins. No players are allowed to look at the three cards inside the Solution Cards envelope until they are out of the game. The game starts with everyone rolling the dice, the highest rolled starts and the game proceeds clockwise. Each player's suggestion must include the room that they are in at the time. If you are making a final accusation, you can accuse a room you are not in. After making a final accusation, the player should look at the cards in the Solution Cards envelope. If all cards are correct, the player can show everyone else as proof. If even one is wrong, the cards go back into the Solution Cards envelope in the middle of the board. The game carries on without the accusing player able to play.</p><center>

               <center><p style="max-width:50vw;text-align: center;  " class="fs-3">1. First thing's first: look at your cards and note down the weapon, room and character on your detective notebook sheet. You now know it is neither of these things inside the envelope.</p><center>
               <center><p style="max-width:50vw;text-align: center;  " class="fs-3">2. Whoever is Miss Scarlet goes first in Cluedo. The game then continues to the left of Miss Scarlet.</p><center>
               <center><p style="max-width:50vw;text-align: center;  " class="fs-3">3. First of all, roll both dice. Ideally, you want to be able to enter a room every turn as once inside, you can make a suggestion. There are secret passages to make this easier. </p><center>
                   <center><p style="max-width:50vw;text-align: center;  " class="fs-3">4. Move your game token the number of spaces you roll. You can move up, down or to the side, but not diagonally. You may not share a space with another character.</p><center>
               <center><p style="max-width:50vw;text-align: center;  " class="fs-3">5. Once inside a room, you can use the process of elimination to guess the weapon, character and room inside the case file envelope. You must move the weapon and character into the room you are suggesting. Once a suggestion is made, the person on the left of you must reveal if they have any cards you mentioned in their hand. If so, they must show you (and no one else) one card; you can then cross this off your detective notebook sheet and that's your turn over. If not, the next person can reveal one of their cards. If no cards are revealed, you can then accuse these three cards meaning you may have won the game.</p><center>
               <center><p style="max-width:50vw;text-align: center;  " class="fs-3">6. You can only make one accusation per game – be sure to do this only when you are certain you know what's in that envelope. After you've made an accusation, you may look inside the envelope. If your accusation matches the cards in the envelope, you have won! If not, the game will continue but you won't be allowed to play.</p><center>
